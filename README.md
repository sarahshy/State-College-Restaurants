# What should I eat for dinner?

## Project Description
This is a side project for exploring the restaurants in the State College area and their Yelp ratings. The research questions include:
- What types of restaurants dominate the food scene in SC?
- Which restaurants are most highly rated?
- What do reviewers look for when reviewing restaurants?

## Data Description
The data was collected from the Yelp API. Therefore, the conclusions drawn assume that all State College restaurants are listed on Yelp and that the reviews are representative of the general State College restaurant-goer population.

Limitations: The Yelp API allows up to 50 businesses. I stick with 50 businesses as this is for fun, although there are ways around this.

## Dear Reader
All R code used for analysis and reporting can be found in sc_restaurants.Rmd.
